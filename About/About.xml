	<description>The mysterious horned and feathered humanoid found on some rim worlds, Oni are often sought out by Glitterworlds for their beauty as a sort of exotic pet. Worse still some are kept as livestock for their feathers, pelts and horns, all having practical and decorative uses. Oni live in temperate areas and rarely employ clothing due to the uncomfortable sensation on their feathered bodies. Due to this, they are highly vulnerable to being set on fire.

In comparison of base human stats, Oni are more attuned with nature and are more physically suited to a wider set of environments, and do not care about being nude or sleeping on the floor. They are more adaptable in unarmed combat, using their razor sharp nails to claw away at their target, and able to use their horn for impaling. All natural attacks can cause bleeding. In social fights, their damage is restrained so they don't cut off a limb or cause excessive hemorrhaging.
With them being more focused on the physical and nature side, they have little trouble with grasping the scientific concepts and and precisions of construction and crafting. When building or fixing machinery, they can seemingly be a little bit clumsy, more likely to make small critical mistakes leading to failure.
At least with crafting, they simply take little bit longer to not make such mistakes, although they have completely no issues with tailoring or artistic work.

They got a tiny bit more difficulties in making safe meals, due to them perceiving food and ingredients a little different to us humans. They are more than happy casually eat things raw, including insect meat.

To acquire Oni Feathers, an Oni may preen themselvs at a crafting spot, using Demon Breath Ointment (Basically a crafting bill carried out by a Oni). Another option, much to the dislike of the Oni, is to force shear feathers off them as a operation bill. Be warned, they will be VERY unhappy, and it has a cool down.
Oni also randomly gain a hediff shown in the health tab, to shed feathers and horn fragments. When it is active, it'll periodically drop Oni Feathers and Oni Horn Fragments respectively.  Only player and prisoner Oni's will spawn the items, and only if they're not downed. Feathers won't spawn when they have cool down of being force sheared.

Three new plants, each involved with the Oni tribal culture. They are locked behind a fairly quick research that an Oni needs to perform to teach your colonists. Already known in Oni starts.
-Featherleaf - A cousin variant of the smokeleaf. Oni's smoking the joint will periodically shed a few extra feathers whilst high on it.
-Demon Breath - A plant with healing properties and also a spice of sorts only appealing to the Oni. Other races will not enjoy the Oni-styled recipes that uses this.
-Yokai Pepper - Functions as a raw vegetable, but also used in a few drug recipes and in their delicacy meal.

Oni wine made through their own specialised fermenting barrels, and Oni smelly jelly is a Oni specific recreation food that only they can eat, as other humanlike races will not even consider its consumption.
A drug line based off Oniamine, a precursor chemical that can be extracted from Oni feathers, horn fragments, pelts and... Their meat. The drugs currently are mainly short term combat boosts, that will make the user a bit more easily tired and hungry once the effects wear off.
New yokai narcotic poison, that can be used to make a new blowpipe dart weapon, mortar shells or IED trap.

New weapons
Fukiya - A simple weapon consisting of a narrow, long tube for firing light projectiles or darts. While the dart itself is not so lethal, it has narcotic poison on the tip. Low base damage. As severity increases the target will suffer reduced consciousness, manipulation and moving speed, eventually leading to a knock-out if poisoned enough.
War Kunai - The Oni Warr kunai are fearsome. In the trained hands, these can be a devastating tool both in melee and ranged combat.

New Animal
The scientific name of this great owl is Ornimegalonyx. It is a flightless owl with immensely powerful legs and talons. Standing over a meeter tall and having solid bones, they are terrifying hunters. Living in groups, 
it is very uncommon to encounter a singular individual. Males are easy to identify by large head plumage. Very intelligent and can be trained, however they can be as vicious as a Warg when angry.
-High attack speed
-High movement speed
-Advanced training 
Predatory - Can and will eat you, good news is they are fairly easy to take down from range

New Ancestral Oni race recently added. They are more rare than your normal Oni, being significantly more primal and animalistic in nature, and have different stat bases.
They do not have thoughts regarding ill treatment to other humanlikes that are strangers, dead or alive, due to their perception they are simply another animal, just "smarter". As such, eating humanlike meat is like any other meat laying around.
