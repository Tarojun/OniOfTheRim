# Oni of the Rim race mod for RimWorld.

The mysterious horned and feathered humanoid found on some rim worlds, Oni are often sought out by Glitterworlds for their beauty as a sort of exotic pet. Worse still some are kept as livestock for their feathers, pelts and horns, all having practical and decorative uses. Oni live in temperate areas and rarely employ clothing due to the uncomfortable sensation on their feathered bodies. Due to this, they are highly vulnerable to being set on fire.
